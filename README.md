# What the F is this tool?

This tool is your intelligent assistant for listening to audio recordings, YouTube videos, lectures, and more. It automatically transcribes speech and summarizes the content into clear, structured notesâ€”making it easy to review, study, or share important information from any audio or video source.

## Features
- **Automatic device selection:** Detects and uses GPU if available, otherwise falls back to CPU.
- **Batch audio processing:** Processes all audio files in the `audio` folder automatically.
- **Auto-cleanup:** Automatically deletes audio files that have already been processed.
- **Speed file handling:** If a file with `_speed` in its name exists, only processes the `_speed` file and skips the original.
- **Optimized speed:** For long files, automatically finds and creates an optimal speed version for faster processing (unless a `_speed` file already exists).
- **YouTube audio support:** Download and transcribe audio directly from YouTube links.
- **Flexible CLI:** Supports both automatic and manual modes, with full CLI argument support for scripting and automation.
- **Manual file management:** In manual mode, allows you to select, skip, or delete files interactively.
- **Seamless Gemini integration:** Processes transcripts with Gemini for advanced post-processing.
- **Output management:** Saves both raw and processed transcripts to the `output` folder.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- FFmpeg installed on your system
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended)
- PyTorch

## Installation Guide

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

#### Installing PyTorch
##### Windows
1. Visit [PyTorch's official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
2. Select your preferences:
   - PyTorch Build: Stable
   - Your OS: Windows
   - Package: Pip
   - Language: Python
   - Compute Platform: CUDA (if you have NVIDIA GPU) or CPU
3. Copy and run the generated command. For example:
   ```bash
   # For CUDA (GPU) support:
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

   # For CPU only:
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```

##### macOS
```bash
# For CPU only:
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio

# For MPS (Apple Silicon) support:
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

##### Linux
```bash
# For CUDA (GPU) support:
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# For CPU only:
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

#### Installing FFmpeg
##### Windows
1. Download FFmpeg from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (choose Windows build).
2. Extract the downloaded zip file.
3. Add the `bin` folder (inside the extracted FFmpeg folder) to your system PATH environment variable.
4. Open a new Command Prompt and run:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```
   You should see FFmpeg version info if installed correctly.

##### macOS (with Homebrew)
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

##### Ubuntu/Debian Linux
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

##### Other Linux
Refer to your distribution's package manager or see [FFmpeg official instructions](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

### 2. Install the Tool
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```
2. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Gemini API
1. Go to [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and sign in with your Google account.
2. Click "Create API key" and follow the instructions.
3. Copy the generated API key.
4. Create a file named `.env` in the project root (if it doesn't exist).
5. Add the following line to your `.env` file:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
6. Save the file. You're ready to use Gemini features!

## Usage Guide

### 1. Prepare Required Folders
Before running the script, make sure you have the following folders in your project directory:
```bash
mkdir -p audio output
```
- `audio/` : Place your audio (wav/mp4) files here for processing
- `output/` : Transcripts and Gemini-processed results are saved here

### 2. Running the Tool

#### Quick Start (Auto Mode, Recommended)
```bash
python phowhisper.py
```
Or:
```bash
python phowhisper.py --mode auto
```
- Automatically selects GPU/CPU, processes and cleans up files.
- Suitable for batch, cronjob, or bash script usage.

#### Manual Mode
```bash
python phowhisper.py --mode manual
```
- Lets you choose device and manage files interactively.

Or specify device directly:
```bash
python phowhisper.py --mode manual --device cpu
python phowhisper.py --mode manual --device cuda
```

#### Process YouTube Audio
```bash
python phowhisper.py https://youtube.com/watch?v=xxxx
```

### 3. File Handling Rules
- If a file with `_speed` in its name exists in the `audio` folder, only the `_speed` file is processed; the original is skipped.
- If a file has already been processed (a corresponding `_processed.txt` exists in `output`), it is automatically deleted from `audio`.
- If the file is a `_speed` file, it is processed directly without optimal speed detection.

### 4. CLI Arguments
- `--mode auto|manual` : Select automatic or manual mode (default: auto)
- `--device cpu|cuda` : Specify device in manual mode

### 5. Output Files
For each processed audio file, the following files are generated in the `output` folder:
- `[filename].txt` - Raw transcription
- `[filename]_processed.txt` - Processed and structured content

## Project Structure
- `audio/` - Directory for input audio files
- `output/` - Directory for transcription results
- `phowhisper.py` - Main script
- `systemprompt` - Gemini AI processing instructions
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
